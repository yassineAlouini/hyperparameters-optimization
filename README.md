# hyperparameters-optimization-talk


# About

This is a the accompanying repo for the Bdx hyperparameters optimization meetup.



# Installation

To install the project dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements`

If you are familiar with Conda, I would suggest creating a virtual environnement
and installing the dependencies in the following fashion:

`conda create --name hyperparameters-optimization --file requirements.txt`

Then activate the environment with the following command:

`source activate hyperparameters-optimization`
