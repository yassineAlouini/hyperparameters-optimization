# How to optimize hyperparameters?

At Qucit, we strive to improve the life of citizens by making cities more efficient and liveable. In order to make this dream a reality,
we are building a predictive platform.
At the core of this platform lies a set of general purpose machine learning algorithms that given enough urban data and a phenomenon (say vehicle congestion, parking fraud or shared car mobility), will predict it for future time values.

Moreover, the models

It is often hard and time-consuming to tune a machine learning and becomes infeasible when the model complexity …. How to tune it ? How to. First, let’s start with the basics of machine learning.


## A primer on machine learning

Machine learning is a systematic approch to "teach" computers how to automatically learn and predict from data without using hard-coded rules.

Let's say we want to predict the air quality. Given data about CO2, NOX, weather conditions and so on, a machine learning algorithm can do it.

## On the importance of hyperparameters

Wihtout tuning hyperparmeters, it is often easy to fall into the trap of overfitting.

## Strategies to optimize them

There are two broad families for optimizing hyperparameters:

* A methodic approach, called "grid search"
* A randomized approach

## Sequential model based optimization

## Hyperopt to the rescue

Hyperopt is a Python library that
